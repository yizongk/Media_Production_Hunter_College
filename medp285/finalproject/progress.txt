Here's the worklist:

* Chat box will be scroll-able
* Show dark chat button only update when click. As of right now, once clicked once, it will keep updating non stop.
* Make show dark chat box scroll-able
* Find icon of same size for wall, blank, and player
* implement some visual for the game

long term idea

* Have scrpit run in the background, accepts client input somehow
* on client side, will show game info, chat info and player online info base on database in back end script.
